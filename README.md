Adjust integration for analytics-ios.

## Installation

To install the Segment-Adjust integration, simply add this line to your [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "Segment-Adjust"
```

## Usage

After adding the dependency, you must register the integration with our SDK.  To do this, import the Adjust integration in your `AppDelegate`:

```
#import <Segment-Adjust/SEGAdjustIntegrationFactory.h>
```

And add the following lines:

```
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];

[config use:[SEGAdjustIntegrationFactory instance]];

[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];

```

## IDFA tracking for iOS14


1. Add the AppTrackingTransparency.framework - This framework is needed in iOS 14 and later for SDK to be able to wrap user's tracking consent dialog and access to value of the user's consent to be tracked or not.
2. Add `"Privacy - Tracking Usage Description"` to your app Info.plist with a string indicating your intentions for tracking a user's IDFA.
3. Implement the Adjust SDK App-tracking authorization wrapper, to conveniently and efficiently communicate the new state of consent to the backend. As soon as a user responds to the pop-up dialog, it's then communicated back using your callback method. The SDK will also inform the backend of the user's choice.

```
Adjust.requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler().then((status) {
  switch (status) {
    case 0:
      // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined case
      break;
    case 1:
      // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted case
      break;
    case 2:
      // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied case
      break;
    case 3:
      // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized case
      break;
  }
});
```
4. Allow Segment to collect the IDFA by implement the `adSupportBlock` as documented in [Segment IDFA Collection documentation.](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios/#idfa-collection-in-40-beta-and-later)
